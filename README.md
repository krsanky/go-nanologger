# Nanologger

This is meant to be a persistent program to log messages from
(lightweight) client programs via [nanomsg](https://nanomsg.org/).
It started as a way to (centrally) log messages from stateless
fastcgi programs on OpenBSD.

I will try to implement sample clients in C, Go, Python, and Clojure.
